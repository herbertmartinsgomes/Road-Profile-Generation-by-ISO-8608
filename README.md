Road Profile Generation by ISO 8608

This Repository contains a code to generate road profiles tracks by ISO 8608 in the time domain and check the generated signals in the wave number domain according to ISO 8608. It also allows correlations between adjacent road tracks and time delays for front and rear tires spaced by a wheel-base for any number of tires.
If you use or modify this version of the code, please always refer to original code developes and DOI code below.
